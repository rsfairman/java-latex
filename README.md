Use LaTeX commands from Java

The pair of programs, getaux and replabels, allows using the LaTeX
commands \ref, \pageref and \verb to be used within Java comments to
refer to external documentation written in LaTeX.

There is a [short tutorial](overtheyardarm.net/making/haskell/haskell_root.html)
explaining how the programs work, and how to use them.
